# movie-findr-client

## Description

This is the front-end for my movie-findr app!
This project goes along with the [movie-find-api](https://github.com/jarengisner/movie_findr_api)
that I created to serve as a back-end for this application. This project was built using React, Javascript and React-Bootstrap.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to build a seamless application using both front-end and back-end technologies together to create a full stack application. The application serves the purpose of highlighting use of these technologies to serve different views pertaining to movies and information about those movies.
